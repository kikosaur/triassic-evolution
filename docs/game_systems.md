## 1. Biological Classification

### Species

| Species | Scientific Name | Diet | Time Period | Size | Description |
|---------|-----------------|------|-------------|------|-------------|
| **Archosaur** | *Archosauria* | Herbivore | 252 MYA | 0.5m × 1m | The 'great-grandfather' of dinosaurs and crocodiles. A rugged survivor of the arid scrublands. |
| **Lagosuchus** | *Lagosuchus* | Herbivore | 237–228 MYA | 0.3m × 0.5m | A small, hopping reptile. Not a dinosaur yet, but very close. Known as 'The Rabbit Reptile'. |
| **Eoraptor** | *Eoraptor lunensis* | Carnivore | 231–228 MYA | 0.5m × 1m | The first true dinosaur. 'The Dawn Thief' eats both bugs and plants to survive in the seasonal oasis. |
| **Herrerasaurus** | *Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis* | Carnivore | 231–228 MYA | 1.5m × 4m | An agile hunter with a sliding jaw joint designed to grapple and hold onto struggling prey. |
| **Panphagia** | *Panphagia protos* | Herbivore | 231–228 MYA | 0.7m × 1.5m | It looks like a meat-eater, but its stomach is evolving to digest plants. A transitionary species. |
| **Coelophysis** | *Coelophysis bauri* | Carnivore | 221–196 MYA | 1m × 3m | Fast, slender hunters that rely on speed rather than strength. Their hollow bones make them incredibly light. |
| **Plateosaurus** | *Plateosaurus engelhardti* | Herbivore | 214–204 MYA | 3m × 8m | A heavy, barrel-chested giant. It is capable of walking on two legs or dropping to all four to feed. |
| **Liliensternus** | *Liliensternus liliensterni* | Carnivore | 228–208 MYA | 1.5m × 5m | The largest predator of the Triassic. Recognizable by the distinct crests on its skull used for display. |
| **Riojasaurus** | *Riojasaurus incertus* | Herbivore | 228–208 MYA | 3m × 10m | A massive, four-legged tank. This true giant is the ancestor to the massive Sauropods like Brachiosaurus. |

### Evolutionary Traits

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Upright Stance** | Legs positioned directly under the body, allowing for more efficient movement and larger size. |
| **Perforate Acetabulum** | An open hip socket that allows the legs to swing freely, enabling faster and more efficient stride. |
| **Serrated Teeth** | Specialized teeth with saw-like edges for slicing through flesh efficiently. |
| **Leaf-Shaped Teeth** | Teeth adapted for shredding coarse plant matter, essential for early herbivores. |
| **Intramandibular Joint** | A flexible jaw joint that allows the jaw to expand, helping in swallowing larger chunks of food. |
| **Gastroliths** | Stomach stones swallowed to help grind up tough plant material in the digestive tract. |
| **Hollow Bones** | Lightweight, air-filled bones that reduce weight without sacrificing strength, allowing for larger sizes and agility. |
| **Elongated Neck** | Allows reach into higher vegetation, accessing food sources unavailable to other herbivores. |
| **Fused Ankles** | Provides greater stability and support for bearing immense weight. |
| **Cranial Crest** | A visual display structure on the skull, likely used for species recognition or mating displays. |
| **Quadrupedalism** | Walking on four legs to support extreme body mass. |
| **Gigantism** | Evolutionary trend towards massive size to deter predators and reach high foliage. |

## 2. Ecological Representation

### Biome Phases

The Triassic period featured dynamic environmental transitions based on climate and vegetation:

| Phase | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Desert** | Arid landscapes with sparse vegetation. Hot and dry conditions favor small, hardy species. |
| 2 | **Oasis** | Transitional zones with moderate vegetation near water sources. Supports a wider variety of life. |
| 3 | **Jungle** | Lush environments with abundant vegetation. Supports large herbivores and apex predators. |

### Species-Biome Preferences

Different species adapted to thrive in specific environmental conditions:

| Species | Preferred Biome | Adaptations |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Archosaur | Desert | High tolerance to arid conditions |
| Lagosuchus | Desert | Small size, efficient water retention |
| Eoraptor | Oasis | Thrives near seasonal water sources |
| Herrerasaurus | Oasis | Ambush predator near watering holes |
| Panphagia | Oasis | Transition grazer, flexible diet |
| Coelophysis | Jungle | Fast pack hunter in dense vegetation |
| Plateosaurus | Jungle | High browser reaching tall vegetation |
| Liliensternus | Jungle | Apex predator of forested environments |
| Riojasaurus | Jungle | Massive herbivore requiring abundant food |

### Habitat Features

Key environmental features that supported Triassic life:

| Habitat | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ephemeral Pools** | Temporary bodies of water formed by rainfall, crucial for early Triassic survival. |
| **Fern Plains** | Low-lying plants that thrive in humid environments. Ideal for grazing herbivores. |
| **River Systems** | Flowing water networks that support lush vegetation and sustain larger populations. |
| **Cycad Groves** | Dense groves of seed plants that provide high-energy food for growing herbivores. |
| **Conifer Forests** | Vast evergreen forests that dominate the landscape, offering abundant resources. |

### Environmental Stress

- Species have preferred biome conditions where they thrive
- Living outside their ideal environment causes stress and reduced lifespan
- Environmental tolerance varies by species—some are hardier than others

## 3. Resource Dynamics

### Ecosystem Resources

The Triassic ecosystem operates on two primary resource types:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Vegetation** | Plant matter consumed by herbivores. Includes ferns, cycads, and conifers. |
| **Critters** | Small animals (insects, amphibians) consumed by carnivores. |

### Food Chain Dynamics

**Herbivores** depend on vegetation density:
- Consume plant matter to survive
- Larger herbivores require more vegetation
- Population limited by available plant resources

**Carnivores** depend on critter density:
- Consume small animals as primary food source
- When critters are scarce, may hunt herbivores (desperation behavior)
- Population limited by available prey

### Habitat Items

Environmental additions that increase ecosystem capacity:

| Item | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Fern Bundle** | Vegetation | Basic ground cover that increases plant density. |
| **Cycad Crate** | Vegetation | Dense foliage providing substantial food for herbivores. |
| **Jar of Beetles** | Critters | Small insects serving as snacks for hunters. |
| **Dragonfly Swarm** | Critters | High-protein feast for carnivorous species. |

### Species Consumption

Different species have varying metabolic needs based on their size and diet:

| Species | Diet | Consumption Level | Lifespan |
|---------|------|-------------------|----------|
| Archosaur | Herbivore | Low | Short |
| Lagosuchus | Herbivore | Low | Medium |
| Eoraptor | Carnivore | Medium | Medium |
| Herrerasaurus | Carnivore | Medium-High | Medium |
| Panphagia | Herbivore | Medium | Medium |
| Coelophysis | Carnivore | Medium | Long |
| Plateosaurus | Herbivore | High | Long |
| Liliensternus | Carnivore | Medium | Very Long |
| Riojasaurus | Herbivore | Very High | Very Long |

### Ecosystem Balance Rules

1. **Herbivores** consume vegetation—more herbivores means faster vegetation depletion
2. **Carnivores** consume critters—hunting pressure affects small animal populations
3. **Desperation Behavior:** Hungry carnivores with no critters will hunt herbivores
4. Larger species require more resources but contribute more to ecosystem productivity
5. Balancing herbivore and carnivore populations is essential for ecosystem stability
